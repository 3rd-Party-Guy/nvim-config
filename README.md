# Neovim Configuration

I have been using Neovim for quite a while so I thought I should back my configuration up somewhere.

Here are some details:
- Uses NvChad as a base
- Custom pureblack base46 theme
- LSP configuration and automatic loading using Mason and mason.lspconfig
- jkl; instead of hjkl for navigation

I also use ghostty as my terminal emulator, but its configuration is much more minimal, so I will just post it here.

# Ghostty configuration
```
theme = dark:CGA,light:ayu_light

font-family = "Iosevka Nerd Font"

window-decoration = none
window-padding-x = 0
window-padding-y = 0
window-padding-color = extend-always
```
